The developer of a program is always responsible for its use.
When a developer has written a program that can be used for intentional harm that developer should also write a program to limit it's ability to cause harm. Sadly That is not the case. 
The developer knows exactly what the program can do. Good and Bad. When he or she doesn't add a  program or license giving the owner a choice of allowing it on his or her device, then the developer is responsible for it's use. Imagine a woman giving birth then stating she is not responsible for it's care.
